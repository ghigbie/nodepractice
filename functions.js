//Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform
//some task. Once a function is created, it can be resused over and
//over in your code. If you find yourselft repeating statments in your code,
// then a function may be the answer to avoid repetition.
//DRY - Don't repeat yourselft

//Function in javascript are frist class objects...They can have properties
//and methods just like any other object. Where they differ, is in the fact that
// functions can be called.
